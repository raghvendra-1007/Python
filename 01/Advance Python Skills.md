# Advance Python Skills

Once you’re comfortable with Python essentials, it’s these advanced skills that will help you level up. They take you from simply writing code that works to building software that is efficient, maintainable, and production-ready.

And here’s the reality - the demand for advanced Python skills is growing fast. Companies today want more than just basic Python knowledge. They need professionals who can build scalable systems, write clean and reusable code, debug performance issues, and contribute to production-grade solutions.

Whether you’re working in data science, backend engineering, automation, or API development - these concepts will let you handle complexity with confidence.

## Topics to Master

### 1. Deep OOP & Design Patterns
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is the foundation of organized, scalable Python code. But to truly master it, you need to go beyond simple classes and objects. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common design challenges.

**What to cover:**
- Classes, objects, inheritance (solidify your understanding of OOP basics)
- Design patterns: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Builder, Strategy

**Why this matters:** These help you structure large applications in a way that’s clean, flexible, and easy to maintain.

### 2. Decorators
Decorators allow you to extend or modify the behavior of functions or methods without changing their code.

**What to cover:**
- Writing your own decorators
- Using built-in decorators like @staticmethod, @classmethod, @property

**Why this matters:** Decorators keep your code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and clean while adding functionality like logging, validation, or access control.

### 3. Getters and Setters
Control how data is accessed or modified inside your classes using properties.

**What to cover:**
- The @property decorator
- Writing getters and setters for flexible, safe data access

**Why this matters:** Helps enforce rules and protect your data from accidental misuse.

### 4. Iterators
Iterators give you control over how you loop through data.

**What to cover:**
- The iterator protocol (__iter__, __next__)
- Custom iterators
- Generators and generator expressions for memory efficiency

**Why this matters:** Lets you work with large or complex datasets without consuming too much memory.

### 5. Context Managers
Make sure resources like files or connections are properly managed.

**What to cover:**
- The with statement
- Writing custom context managers (__enter__, __exit__)

**Why this matters:** Helps you write safer code that cleans up after itself, avoiding leaks and errors.

### 6. Parallelism (Multiprocessing, Threading, Async I/O)
Speed up your programs by running tasks at the same time.

**What to cover:**
- The multiprocessing module
- The threading module
- asyncio for asynchronous programming

**Why this matters:** Essential for speeding up I/O-heavy or compute-heavy applications, like data processing or API calls.

### 7. Writing Custom Modules
Break large programs into smaller, reusable parts.

**What to cover:**
- Creating modules
- Importing and using your own modules

**Why this matters:** Keeps code organized and makes it easier to maintain or share.

### 8. Packaging
Share your Python code with the world.

**What to cover:**
- Structuring a Python package
- Writing a setup.py
- Basics of publishing to PyPI (optional at first)

**Why this matters:** Lets you build tools that others (or you!) can install and reuse easily.

### 9. Testing
Good code is tested code.

**What to cover:**
- Unit testing with unittest or pytest
- Integration testing
- Writing meaningful tests that catch errors before users do

**Why this matters:** Builds confidence in your code and helps you catch problems early.

### 10. Performance Profiling
Don’t stop at “it runs” - make it run well.

**What to cover:**
- Using cProfile, timeit, and other tools
- Finding bottlenecks
- Techniques for speeding up slow code

**Why this matters:** Helps your applications scale and perform reliably as they grow.

## Salary Difference: Essentials vs Advanced Python Skills

Mastering advanced Python concepts doesn’t just make you a better coder - it often reflects directly in your compensation.

- **Python Essentials Only:** A developer with just the basics (variables, data structures, functions, OOP, etc.) can expect average salaries starting from ₹5-8 LPA (India) or $60k-$85k (US) depending on experience and role.
- **Advanced Python Skills:** Professionals who know advanced concepts like design patterns, decorators, parallelism, packaging, and testing often earn significantly more - typically ₹10-20 LPA (India) or $100k-$140k (US) as they qualify for senior roles, backend engineering, or data engineering positions.

This is just an estimate - actual salaries vary by location, domain, and company. But investing time in mastering these advanced skills clearly sets you apart in the job market.

## Final Thoughts

Learning advanced Python isn’t about memorizing more syntax - it’s about thinking like a software engineer. These skills help you design better solutions, build software that lasts, and stand out in the job market.

If you master these, Python stops being just a tool - it becomes your superpower for solving complex, real-world problems.
